  <h2> Karma Grove </h2>
<p>

  <%= link_to "Karma", "#jump-to-karma" %> <%= link_to "Grove", "#jump-to-grove"%> is a charitable organization, but also more than that. We believe we can make the world better through <i>conscious commerce</i>--empowering the consumer to make a posititive impact with more intelligent purchases. 90% of the profits from all transactions in our marketplace are given to environmental charities. But unlike a traditional fundraiser, Karma grove gives both parties involved in the deal an <i>equal</i> say in whom the proceeds will benefit.

</p>

<p>
  Karma Grove not only facilates conscious commerce through it's marketplace, but it also also participates in fundraising directly through the sale of <b><%= link_to "Karma Coins", "/Karma-Coin-Facts" %></b>.
</p>

<h4>50/50 Partners</h4>
<p>
   The money you exchange for Karma Coins goes directly to a local charities. You decide what charity will benefit from 50% of the sale's proceeds. We believe <i>this is your right</i>, and we apply this same policy to everything you purchase with and from Karma Grove.
</p>
<p>
   As the producer of Karma Coins, our employees pledge the remaining profits to a charity of their own choice. We believe this is their right as the hard-working creators of this delicious treat. For more information on donations, <%= link_to "click here", "#" %>.

 <p>
   Karma Grove is transparent. We're open. We don't keep secrets. All donations made from Karma Coin sales and in the marketplace are tracked and detailed reports our posted here, on our website.

<h2> The Story Behind Karma Grove </h2>

<p>
  Joshua Montross founded Karma Grove on his own personal philosophy, that justice and charity aren't so different, and that business doesn't have to exploitative. Here's his story:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><i>
  As a sophomore in college, I was a distressed international business student. I was anxious at the prospect of entering a world of such growing gaps between the rich and the poor.
</i>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
   <blockquote><i>
    I was in Washington, DC and I had grown disillusioned with the economic doctrine of rational self-interest that was taught to me in my economics courses.  I also felt that the <a target="new" href="#"> agency problem </a> could only be alleviated using a corporate structure that did not separate owner and worker or corporate interest and community interest.</i>
   </blockquote>
 </p>

 <blockquote>
 <i>
<p>
  I began spending more and more time at the Gelman Libaray at GWU. I was reading a lot of philosophy and became intrigued with the semantic similarity between charity and justice in the Hebrew language.  I ended up writing an essay, and developed the concept for a business that allowed its customers to give away half of the profits, the employees to give away thirty percent, to keep ten percent for growth, and to give ten percent to employees as a bonus on top of wages.  I initially wanted to form a cafe and call it Karma Cafe and replace that damn Starbucks in the basement of Gelman.
</p>
</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
  <blockquote>
  <i>
  I did not win the philosophy contest, and for a long time,  Karma Cafe only existed in my writing and dreams.
</i>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
  <blockquote>
    <i>
  Following stints as a project manager and software engineer in the District, I moved to California in 2011. While there, one of my good friends, <b><%= link_to "Magan Biggs", "https://twitter.com/maganbunny" %></b>, taught me to make (particularly delicious) granola bars.  I tweaked her recipe and made it a little more to my taste, and what I began to call Joy Coins were born.
</i>
</blockquote>
<p>

  <p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>
  I named them Joy Coins because I had a nice roommate named Joy who suggested I stop using butter to make them vegetarian.  My friends loved them and I realized I could combine my passion, my Karma Cafe business model, with my tasty treats that people were already enjoying. Later this same recipe is what became <b><%= link_to "Karma Coins", "/Karma-Coin-Facts" %></b> when I began to market them and sell under the name Karma Grove.  I believed I could build a brand around Karma.
</i>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
  <blockquote>
  </i>
  Another year went by, and I found myself laid off from my fancy technical job at www.empowered.com--just a week before Christmas. I was 27 and I had no savings. So, I set about looking for contracts and new work while I starting to create an auction site using the domain KarmaGrove.com that I had bought so many years before, while still in college.  I was thinking I would make an auction site, and sell my granola bars.  I also began selling my Joy Coins at a cafe in Santa Cruz around this time in January 2013.  Some time shortly after I started calling them Karma Coins.
</i>
  <blockquote>
</p>

<p>
  <blockquote>
    <i>
  I would take the cash collected from the sales of my Karma Coins and give 90% of it to <%= link_to "Grey Bears", "http://www.greybears.org/items-needed/" %>.  The receipts are still all proudly displayed on Karma Grove's <%= link_to "twitter feed", "https://twitter.com/karmagrove"%>.  I began to build relationships with other non-profits I truly appreciated.  Grey Bears was my first partner, feeding the elderly and hungry in Santa Cruz.
</i>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
  So Karma Grove's background. This site is an experiment from Joshua's heart of hearts.  His dream of a paradoxical business, giving away 90% of its profits and having no shareholders, can continue to grow and benefit us and our earth without taking advantage of anyone; or increasing the wealth divide.  It is a snowball that we push up a hill.   Khalil Gibran tells us that all great truths are a paradox.
</p>

<p>
  We hope you enjoyed reading a little bit of history on how this all came to be.  We're here now, and we know it is just the beginning of something great. This site will serve as a marketplace of conscious commerce, flowing money to those in need in our glocal community.
