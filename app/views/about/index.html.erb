  <h2> Who are we? </h2>
  We believe we can make the world better while making tasty treats.  <b><%= link_to "Karma Coins", "/Karma-Coin" %></b> - They are better than money as when you trade your money for nourishment of your body you also nourish your community.  The money you exchange in our grove for goods directly benefits a charity of your choice.  This is your right for buying anything from karma grove.  We are also giving thirty percent of profits to charity.  Why give away eighty percent of profits on a monthly basis?  Why not?

<h2> To know where we are going </h2>
<h2> We must know where we are from </h2>

  As a sophomore in college I was distressed as a finance and international business student to be entering a world of such growing gaps between the rich and the poor.  I was in Washington, DC and I had grown disillusioned with the economic doctrine of rational self-interest that was taught to me in my economics courses.  I also felt that the <a target="new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem"> agency problem </a> could only be alleviated using a corporate structure that did not separate owner and worker or corporate interest and community interest.
</p>
<p>
  We need more servants, fewer masters and slaves.  Capitalism seemed evil, except when I put it against all the other forms.  I felt I had fallen from the perfect garden of my family and first love, and wondered if this life of sensory pleasure - touch - taste - sight - smell - sound - were all that I had as my guide.
</p>
<p>
  I began reading philosophy within the libraries of Gelman and kept asking why as I perused way too many obscure books.  I foolishly entered a Judaic Philosophy contest after discovering the rich Judaica collection on the 7th floor. Intrigued with the semantic similarity between charity and justice in the Hebrew language, I abandoned my thesis that economics ruled the realm of human action and started to realize there was a more intricate flower beneath the cause and effect we know so well.
</p>
<p>
  I learned of the practice of keeping the corner of the field unharvested so that the passerby may thrive on free snacks.  Rather than hollow commands from an invisible creature, I began to see inspired words encouraging a conscious economy that encourages abundant life for all.
</p>

<p>
  I have a really delusional essay I would not recommend anyone read where I developed the concept for a business that allowed its customers to give away half of the profits, the employees to give away thirty percent, to keep ten percent for growth, and to give ten percent to employees as a bonus on top of wages.  I wanted to form a cafe and call it Karma Cafe and replace that damn Starbucks in the basement of Gelman.
</p>

<p>
  I did not win the philosophy contest and Karma Cafe does not exist except in dreams.  The Starbucks in Gelman continues to be frequented by the illustrious students of GW, World Bank employees, and federal employees.  I graduated from college, and Karma Grove lives in the back of mind.

  A silicon valley startup moves me to California in 2011 and soon after I made a friend <b><%= link_to "Magan Biggs", "https://twitter.com/maganbunny" %></b> who taught me to make granola bars.  I tweaked her recipe,My house mate Joy suggested I stop using butter to make them vegetarian, and Joy Coins were born.  My friends loved them and I realized I could combine my passion of my dream cafe business model with my tasty treats that people would buy regardless of the profits destination.  Later this same recipe is what became <b><%= link_to "Karma Coins", "/Karma-Coin" %></b> when I began to market them and sell under the name Karma Grove, planting a stake in the logos of karma in hopes of unraveling many of the troubles we have created.
</p>

<p>
  Another year goes by and I'm laid off in December 2012.  January 2013 the karmagrove application is created on github and continues to be an open source community effort.
</p>
<p>
  For the intermittent bake sales thwat occurred throughotu 2013, I would take the cash collected from the sales and give 90% of it to grey bears.  The receipts are all proudly displayed on the <%= link_to "twitter feed", "http://twitter.com/karmagrove" %>.  I began to make relationships with other non-profits I truly appreciated.  Grey Bears was my first partner, feeding the elderly and hungry in Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  This site is an experiment from my heart of hearts.  A dream that a paradoxical business giving away 90% of its profits and having no shareholders can continue to grow and benefit us and our earth without taking advantage of anyone or increasing the wealth divide.  It is a snowball that I push up a hill - or so I tell myself.   Khalil Gibran tells us that all great truths are a paradox.  I like his poetry.  In fact, it is the words of inspired prophets of old who inspired me to give away all of the profits...
</p>
<p>
  Hope you enjoy the silly little history of how Karma Coins became the first product of Karma Grove.  Hopefully it is just the start of many artisan bake sales for community, and this site will serve as a marketplace of conscious commerce, flowing money to those in need in our glocal community.
