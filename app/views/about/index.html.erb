<h2> History </h2>

<p>
  As a sophomore in college I was distressed as a finance and international business student to be entering a world of such growing gaps between the rich and the poor.  I was in Washington, DC and I had grown disillusioned with the economic doctrine of rational self-interest that was taught to me in my economics courses.  I also felt that the <a target="new" href="#"> agency problem </a> could only be alleviated using a corporate structure that did not separate owner and worker or corporate interest and community interest.
</p>
<p>
  I began reading much philosophy within the libraries of Gelman and soon became intrigued with the semantic similarity between charity and justice in the Hebrew language.  I have a really delusional essay I would not recommend anyone read where I developed the concept for a business that allowed its customers to give away half of the profits, the employees to give away thirty percent, to keep ten percent for growth, and to give ten percent to employees as a bonus on top of wages.  I wanted to form a cafe and call it Karma Cafe and replace that damn Starbucks in the basement of Gelman.
</p>
<p>
  I did not win the philosophy contest and Karma Cafe does not exist except in dreams.
</p>
<p>
  I moved to California in 2011 and <b><%= link_to "Magan Biggs", "https://twitter.com/maganbunny" %></b> taught me to make granola bars.  I tweaked her recipe and made it a little more to my taste, and what I began to call Joy Coins were born.  I named them Joy Coins because I had a nice roommate named Joy who suggested I stop using butter to make them vegetarian.  My friends loved them and I realized I could combine my passion of my dream cafe business model with my tasty treats that people would buy regardless of the profits destination.  Later this same recipe is what became <b><%= link_to "Karma Coins", "/Karma-Coin-Facts" %></b> when I began to market them and sell under the name Karma Grove.  Figured I could build a brand around Karma.
</p>

<p>
  Another year goes by and I'm laid off from my fancy technical job at empowered.com a week before Christmas.  Thankfully I had no savings and set about looking for contracts and new work while I started to create an auction site using the domain KarmaGrove.com that I had bought so many years before in college.  I was thinking I would make an auction site, and sell my granola bars through the site.  I also began placing the Joy Coins at a cafe in Santa Cruz around this time in January 2013.
</p>
<p>
  I would take the cash collected from the sales and give 90% of it to grey bears.  The receipts are all proudly displayed on the twitter feed.  I began to make relationships with other non-profits I truly appreciated.  Grey Bears was my first partner, feeding the elderly and hungry in Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  This site is an experiment from my heart of hearts.  A dream that a paradoxical business giving away 90% of its profits and having no shareholders can continue to grow and benefit us and our earth without taking advantage of anyone or increasing the wealth divide.  It is a snowball that I push up a hill - or so I tell myself.
</p>
<p>
  Hope you enjoy the silly little history of how Joy and Karma Coins became the first product of Karma Grove.  Hopefully it is just the start, and this site will serve as a marketplace of conscious commerce, flowing money to those in need in our glocal community.
