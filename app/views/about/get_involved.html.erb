      Karma Grove is a not-for-profit organization that uses revenue from commercial transactions and to support local charities in a special way. Rather than employing traditional fundraising methods, Karma Grove is built on a novel "conscious commerce" platform, where both parties in a transaction are directly involved in whom the profits benefit.</p>
      <a href="/batches/<%= Batch.last.id =%>/donations/new"><h4>Your Votes Decide Which Charities Benefit</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
       90% of the profits made from each purchase in KarmaGrove.com's marketplace, or in person at a Karma Grove affiliated vendor, will be donated to charity. Of that 90%, 50% is donated to the charity of the buyer's choice, while the remaining 40% is donated to a charity decided upon with out voting system. The entire KarmaGrove community is free to vote on our <a href="/batches/<%= Batch.last.id =%>/donations/new">website here</a>.
