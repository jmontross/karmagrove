"<h5>The Health Benefits of Molasses</h5>
<p> Another sweetener that's light on both the glyemic index and the guilt factor, molasses is a smart alternative to table sugar--and even brown sugar. Its carbohydrates are metabolized much more slowly in the body, demanding less insulin production and helping stabilize blood sugar. The end result is less lipids or fats being stored in the liver, reducing your diabetes 2 risk level. Molasses is also high in iron content and folate, two essentials for red blood cell production.</p>"
