"<h5>The Health Benefits of Coconut Sugar</h5>
<p>Many doctors <a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/coconut-palm-sugar-best-new-sugar-alternative">promote coconut palm sugar</a> as the best sugar alternative available today. That's because it has a far lower glycemic index than other sugars, helping it reduce blood sugar spikes and crashes that cause unhealthy weight gain and food craving. It's also rich in iron, magnesium and zinc--in fact it has almost 40x more iron and 10x more zinc than brown sugar.</p>"
