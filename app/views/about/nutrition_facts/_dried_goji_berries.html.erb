"<h5>The Health Benefits of Goji Berries</h5>
<p>If the fountain of youth came in berry form, it would be a Himalayan Goji berry. A truly super food, Goji berries hail from heavens in Tibet, China and Mongolia and are overflowing with vitamins and nutrients. Not only do they pack more vitamin C per ounce than any other food on earth, but they're outstanding sources of vitamin A, B1, B2, B6 and are complete with all 18 amino acids. To top it all off, they're potent in phytonutrient antioxidants like lutein and zeaxanthin. The combination makes them a perfect medicine for the eyes, nervous and immune system, and they're a great source of energy. </p>"
